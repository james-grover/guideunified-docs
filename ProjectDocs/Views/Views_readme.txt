VIEWS
Views - Initial overview of Required Views

This needs to be broken down further into Components.


Main Page -vie - REQUIRED for MVP
Main page view also contains logged in info at top right.
page will be the same whether user is logged in or not.  The only thing that changes will be the User Acct info
and functionality.

Each Nav bar item shows the essentially the same interface, but will have the items categorized per the Nav Bar icon.
Therefore, in addition to the Main_Page view we will require additional views for the items below.  Only 1 item required for MVP
TV Series  view
Movies view
Playlists view
New Arrivals view
Coming Soon view

Within the Jumbo tron is a link to begin preview.  This will require its own view.  This can be video or static content.  
InfoPreview - info preview directs to selection view.  There is no separate view for this as it will be the same as the Selection View.

There is also a genre Nav bar beneath the JumboTron component.  
Each Genre will also require its own view. - The genre NAVBar will not be functional for MVP.
